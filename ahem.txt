many commands in the tutorial video don't work, probably due to OS or VS.
git --version (just checking version)
git status (show all the tracked files and the untracked)
git add . (track all files)
git commit -m "messages" (save changes)
git push (don't add anything)

Don't mess with SSH keys, even if you generated one you have to tell the local ssh-agent about the key. And I've never been this confused when reading the instruction.
